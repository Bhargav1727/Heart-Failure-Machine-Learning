# Heart-Failure-Machine-Learning,   Status(Complete)
The goal of this project is to predict mortality risk in heart failure patients by developing a model that identifies key health indicators impacting survival, enabling doctors to prioritize high-risk patients and customize treatments. 
# Project Overview
Heart failure is a critical condition where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to a range of health complications. Early detection and intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes, reduce hospital admissions, and enhance quality of life. This project leverages machine learning to predict heart failure risk based on patient clinical data, providing actionable insights to healthcare providers for early and personalized care strategies.
# Business Problem
The objective of this project is to assist healthcare providers in identifying patients at high risk of heart failure. By building a predictive model, I'll aim to help clinicians make informed decisions, enabling preventive actions and targeted interventions. Accurate prediction of heart failure risk can support timely treatment, potentially lowering readmission rates and improving overall patient care.
# Model Selection and Development
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including:

Logistic Regression: Chosen for its interpretability, providing clear insight into how each feature influences the likelihood of heart failure.
Decision Tree: A straightforward, interpretable model that splits data based on feature values to classify patients.
Random Forest: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
XGBoost: An advanced gradient boosting method that iteratively improves predictions by focusing on misclassified instances.
# Model Interpretation
To make the model's predictions more transparent and interpretable for clinical use, I used:

Permutation Importance (ELI5): This method identified age, ejection fraction, and serum creatinine as the top features influencing heart failure risk.
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations): LIME helped in interpreting individual predictions, allowing clinicians to understand the factors contributing to specific patient risk scores.
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): SHAP provided both global and local interpretability, showing how each feature contributes to the model's predictions across the dataset.
# Conclusion
This project successfully developed a predictive model for heart failure risk, providing actionable insights for healthcare providers. The model allows clinicians to focus on high-risk patients, enabling early intervention and improving patient outcomes. With further refinement and additional data, this model could become a powerful tool in personalized patient care and preventive health strategies.
